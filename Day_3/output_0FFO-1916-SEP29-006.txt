“War: on Year: 57th Day;

Steady progress is being made on the British
Front. Yesterday the Scliwoben Redoubt was
attacked. Most of it is in British hands." It
occupies the crest of the Thicpval plateau, with
a full view over the northern valley of the

'Ancrc. , \ , .

Elsewhere also our lines have been advanced;—
northand north-east of Courcelctto and‘bc-
tween Martinpuich and Guoudccourt. TIlicro
we have established posts west and south-west
of Enucourt l‘Abbayc, and are within 800 yards

3 of the village.

The British dispatch last night again commended
highly the work of the airmen, and quoted a
captured report. from the commander of the
German corps who took part in the battle.
He describes the valour of the British infantry,
and complains that the Germans on the Somme
front “found actually no trenches at all ”--a.
tribute‘to the work of the British guns.

The afternoon dispatch showed that the ﬁghting
of the last two days has been “singularly
economical.” 0hr losses are small absolutely,
as well as relatively to the importance of our
gains. , . '

Our Correspondent at Headquarters describes to-

_ day the work of tho “ Tanks ”-—-vcry useful in
the taking of Thicpval and of Gucudceourtl—
and the stem, hidden figllting'tllat Went on in
the warren of German subterranean passages
with which the ground under these strong.
holds is pierced.

The Paris ccmmuniqué yesterday afternoon re-
ported no infantry action on the French front
in the West. It said that the French batteries
“are continuing actively their fire upon the
German organizations.” The evening coins
muniqzlé also mentioned heavy artillery fire.

At Verdun, the enemy has suffered what the

French describe as “ a sanguinary defeat.” I

At nightfall on Wednesday he made a strong
attack against the Thiaumont-Flcury front,
and was driven back by machine-gun and our-
lain lire.

West of Lutsk the Germans have been making
heavy attacks on the Russian lines. The Petro-
grud connmmiqué yesterday referred to this
fighting by saying that the enemy was “ Shaw'-
ing a stubborn resistance, making repeated
counter-attacks and thus hindering our
advance."

The German report made much more of it. It
said that the trenches lost on September 21
had been recaptured and other advantages
gained. It. declared that the Siberian 4th
Army Corps “ suffered losses which ap-
proached almost to complete annihilation.”

The German Imperial Chancellor, speaking at
the opening of the Reichstag, succred ht Italy
for having declared war on Germany, and
violently denounced Rumcnia for having
joined the Allies.

The Provisional Government in Crete has issued
a proclamation signed by M. Venizelos and
Admiral Condouriotis. It declares that the
only hope for Greece is to join the Allies, ap-
pools to'King Constantine to declare himself
on their side, and expresses the determination
of the signatories to lead Greece on that path,
even if he still refuses.

An interview given by Mr. Lloyd George to the
president of the United Prosa of America is
published to-day. Mr. Lloyd George makes it
perfectly plain that this is no time for peace
talk. . , ,

The names of 171 ofﬁcers and 2,560 men are
given in tho ofliciol casualty lists today. In
addition we announce unofﬁcially tho deeth of
18 other ofﬁcers.

GERMANS’ SINGULAR’ EXCUSE.
(most oua srrzcrar. connnsronnnx'r.)

, MISTERDAM. SEPT. 28.
Thiopval is evidently a very tender subject
with the Germans. Until this morning its
loss was not admitted in the German Press.
Last night‘s Berlin newspapers merely referred
to the progress of the enemy near Thiepval
and southeast of Bouchavcsnes. to the loss
(if oi corner of the village at Thiopval, and
to 'the loss of the point of a position south.
west: of Thiopval. The truth comes out to-

on German authority that Thiepvel with

GREEK. GENERALS IN FAVOUR
OF WAR.

V {mom can conunsroxnnx'r.)

' ATHENS, Sum. 27.
The adhesion of Admiral Condouriotis to the
Reform Movement has impressed King Con-
stantino more than anything else.
According to the Nea Helios, all the various
generals whom the King received in audience
yesterday and the day before represented to his
Majesty the necessity of a prompt. abandonment
of neutrality. The report. that the lung has
deﬁnitely decided on u change of policy favour-
able to the Entcnto continues toafind currency.

tion as Chief of the Gcncral Staff is believed to be
a. munmuvro to induce him to retain his post.
If. is stated that. 500 officers are signing a petition
to the King in favour of war against Bulgaria.
M. llullis has bud an interview with the
Premier, M. Knlogeropoulos, and has urged him
to take prompt steps, since events permit of no
further delay.

The so-called “ Nationalists ” under M.
Gonnoris have addressed a proclamation to the
Crotons begging them to hold aloof from the
National Defence movement, and. threatening
them with a reaction. ‘
A mass meeting is being held in Mytilcnc to-
day.

LATER.
General Kolloris, the former Minister of War,
like Goncrul Moschoponlw appears to have
drawn up two reports urgiqg the necessity of
action. Other drst-inguishe l ofﬁcers are in
sympathy with this view.

General Dan lis, another ox-Ministor of War,
has left for Sﬁonika. -

The Cabinet, which is said by tho Hectic:
to be ready to acquiesce in the cooperation
of two or three Vomzelists in the Government,
will probably await the reply of the Entonto
Powers to its recent proposals before taking
any deﬁnite stops.

Public opinion is now inclined to favour the
abandonment of neutrality, and this view is
shared even by tho unti‘Venizolist Press, with
the exception of the Nca Himcra, tho roputod
or an of the old General Staff.

AI. Vonizolos, who met with an enthusiastic
rccoptionon landing in Crete, has delivered a.
speech at Canon. expressing the hope that the
wishes ‘of the nation would be fulﬁlled.

DANGHHS on PASSIVE
- OPPOSITION.

PUBLIC OPINION UNANIMOUS.
We have received the following telegram
from tho Special Correspondent at Athens

,geho recently rent the Message from M.

Venizelos to The Times :—- V

The effect of the departure of M. Vcnizolos
and Admiral Condouriotis on their patriotic
crusade, together with the declarations of the
former to the Greek people (which are on
similar lines to those contained in his messa o
to The Times transmitted in my previous tele-
gram), have created a profound impression
throughout Greece.

Both by his method of action and by his
declarations M. Venizclos has proved his
unwillingness to attack the King, and. he
has shown that the po ular movement under
his leadership is cxc usively patriotic and
for the defence of his country. It. is directed
simultaneously as a final appeal to the King
to come forward. Excepting tho pro-German
faction, all in Greece, including the vast majority
of Army and Navy officers, are urging the King
to declare war against Bulgaria and to do his
duty by the nation. ‘

It is difﬁcult. to anticipate what tho King‘s

persists much

 

 

sition may become if he
anger in his presuut practically isolated attitude
of possrvo opposition to the popular will.

PRINCE ANDREW 0F GREECE.
Prince Andrew of Greece yesterday received
a telegram from King Constantino requesting
him, according to Renter’s Agency,to leave for
Paris, where he will receive fresh instructions.
The date of departure has not yet. been fixed.

 

Prince Andrew of Greece, the youngest
brother of King Constantino, came recently to
London on a special mission. It is understood
that. his instructions, which woro’of a very pre-
cise nature, were to justify the action of .Iiing
Constantine in the eyes of the British Govern-
ment and of the British Royal Farriil '. There
is no reason to'beliovo that he found favour in
the eyes of responsible members of tho Govern-
ment or of its representatives ; but it is possible
that the theory and practice of government in
constitutional countries may have been authori-
tatively explained to him. v

SIR D. Herc. ON .. OUR
LOSSES.
THE LINE ADVANCED air
3 VARIOUS POINTS.
The following telegrdphic dispatcher were

received yesterday from. General Head-
quarters in France 2—- _' .

2,55 RBI—During the night out lin
was advanced at various points between
Martinpuich and Guoudecourt, and posts

were established west and south-west of

Eaucourt'l’Abbayo and within 800 yards
of that village.

0n the left of our front our position
was consolidated on the ridge north-east
of Thiepval. .

A battalion of enemy infantry, with
transport, was caught on the match by
our artillery, and successquy shelled.

The ﬁghting during the past few days
has been singularly economical. Our losses
are small, not only relatively tb the im-
portance of 'our gains, but absolutely.
Our total casualties are not more than
twice the number of enemy prisoners
taken. One division, which had a. 8 col.
ally difﬁcult task allotted to it, too as
many prisoners as it suffered casualties.

050 P.M.—-To-da‘y we attacked the
..chwa.bcn Redoubt, most of which is in
our hands. During the past 24 hours in
this area. nearly 600 prisoners have been
taken.

The Redoubt occupies the crest 500
yards north of Thiepval, and represents

the highest. ground on the Thiepval l

Spur, with a. full view over the
northern valley of the Ancrc.
Elsewhere on our front we have con-
solidated our ground and advanced our
lines north and north-east of Courcelette.
British aeroplanes have, as usual, during
the past few days coo crated brilliantly
with the infantry. hiizch damage has
been done to enemy batteries, and there
have been many instances of our a. ro-
plancs attacking troops and transport
on the ground with machine-gun ﬁre.
- A captured report of the ﬁghting on
the Somme issued by the Commander of
the German Corps which took part in the
battle contains a tribute to the quality of
our troops. .
The British infantry are smart in attack,
largely because of their iuunonsc conﬁdence
in their great artillery superiority. One
must admit the skill with which they con-
solidate themsclves in newly-gained positions.
They show great. tenacity in the defence.
Small parties when once established with
machine-guns in the corner of a wood or a
group of houses aro’vcry difficult to dis-
odge.
The following sentence shows the effects
of our artillery :-—
Hitherto our instructions, from cxpori~
cnco gained in defence and attack, were
based on n. carefully-constructed trench

system. The troops on. the Somme front
found actually no trenches at all.

 

FRENCH BATTERIES ACTIVE
ON THE SOMME.
The following French cmlzmum‘gués were
issued yesterday :—
ETERNOON.

0n the Somme front our batteries
actively continued to bombard the Ger-
man organizations.

There were no infantry counter-at-
tacks cluring the night.

Apart from the violent bombardment
which continues on the Somme front
there is nothing of importance to report.
along the whole front. ‘ '

Of especial severity were the attacks on the

completely failed. The detaclunents which
penetrated our lures were at once driven out. ’

The enemy was able to maintain a footing in
small portions of our positions north-west of

THE FAVOURABLE
MOMENT. .

The following wireless message from Berlin
has been received by the Wireless Press :—

Tho Reichstag opened this afternoon with
the usual inspect of similar great days. ".1118
galleries were crowded. All the foreign diplo-
mutists staying in Berlin were present, practi-
cally without exception. 3 ‘ ,

President Kampf, in an introductory speech,
stated that. the military, economic, and political
war had. reached its zenith. On all fronts there were
violent struggles for a. decision. Germany's position
was satisfactory in every respect: The President
mentioned the arrival of the merchant. submarines
Deuuchland and Bremen in the United States and
read the telegrams exchanged with the Emperor at
the beginning of the third year of war.

AMSTERDAM, Sept. 28,—After the President’s
speech the Imperial Chancellor said :—

\\'hcn,. alter Italy’s declaration of war on Austria-
Hungory our Ambassador left Rome, we lufomlcd
the Italian Government that in a. war against Austria~
Hungary they would also have to meet German
troops. ‘ German troops. united with Austro-Ilun-
gar-ion comrades, fought on the Italian front. Thus
a dc [auto state of war was established, and a formal
declaration of war did not follow. Italy obviously
wanted to avoid the fateful consequences for her
economic relations with us after the war. In Rome,
also they would have liked to shift the responsibility
for the initiative upon us, but we had no reason to
play Italy’s game. '

That our tactics were right was proved by the
continual efforts of the Entcntc to induce Italy to
declare war. For more than a year the Italian Govern-
ment. resisted. but finally the thumb-screws became
too painful which England was putting on with the
some ruthlcssncss on neutrals as on the Allies. Italy
in her war is depending on English coal and English
money, but certainly English coercion was declswe,
though perhaps also Italian Balkan n irations may
lavo contributed their share. A3 is wel known Italy
wants territorial extension-in the districts which fall
in the natural sphere of Greek interests. In order
to avoid being passed over completely, Italy con-
sidered it desirable to participate in General Surrail's
expedition. This led to a renewed collision between
Italian and German troops in Macedonia. Thus the
declaration of war on us developed, and at the some
timo Romania joined our enemies.

fl‘uc Tamra: wrm Aus‘mn.

Our relations with Romania before the war rested
on the Treaty of Alliance, which was ﬁrst concluded
only between Austria-Hungary and Rumania, and
was extended by the entry of Germany and Italy.
The signatories bound themselves to reciprocal armed
assistance in case of unprovoked _uttuck from a
third side. When war broke out hing Carol ener-
getically upheld the conception that llumnnimwhic‘n
owed to the Central Powers 30 years of secure
political existence and immense progress, should not
only according to the words of the Treaty, but also on
account of the country's honour, join the Central
Powers. To the late King it. appeared to be a re-
pudiation of the Alliance Treaty to raise the objec-
tion that. Romania had not been informed of the
Austro-Hungnrian dénmrchc against Serbia, and had
not been consulted about it, but in the decisive
Crown Council the aged hing did not. press his
opinion against. the Government, the head of which,
ignoring all existing treaties, sympathized with tho
Entcntc. Shortly afterwards the King died as the
result of mental excitement caused by the conscious-
ness that Rumania lmd betrayed her Allies. ’

_!I‘bo Ilumanian policy under M. Bratiuno's leader-
ship aimed. at. enriching itself without having to
make greatcacrificcs. It. was a question only of
recognizing in time to which side victory ﬁnally
inclined, and than not. to miss the favourable oppor-
tunity for coming in. In the first year of the war,

.,. .

eluded a. neutrality treaty with Russia. behind his
Sovereign's back. After the fall of Przcmysl ho con~
sidcrcd the limo had. come to arrive at. an agreement
with our cnemlw about the reward of Judas. Tho
negotiations failed. Russia. desired to incmsc her
own immense territorial possmsions by adding Buko-
vina. to them. Serbia had thrown e 'a‘. on the Ballot,
while Bumzmia wanted for horse
Bukovina. but all Hungarian territory
Thciss.

Thus no agreement was reached, but Romania’s
neutrality tool: more and more the form of one-
sided favouring of the Eutcnto Powers. In order to
support. England's starvation blockade they tried
to old back corn bought by us. It required our very
energetic pressure to compel its release. After the

ush'ut Gorlicc M. Brationo bud doubts as to whether

c was on the right horse. Negotiations with the
Entcntc, which had been suspended, came visibly to
a. deadlock, because it was always the military situa-
tion which influenced anonian policy. When the
Russians opened their spring offensive, and at the
some time the Somme offensive began M. Broth-mo
thought. ho saw before his eyes the collapse of the
Central Powers. 'ow ho was resolved. to partici-
pate in the anticipated funeral feast.

Fman Nmb'rla'rloxs 1x Bonanza.

The Entcnto Powers also in their negotiations
with .\l. Bratiano had u freer hrmd than heretofore.
Serbia. having been conquered. the protectors
of small and weak nations had no need fur-
ther to consider her former annexation de-
sires. They could be more generous towards
Romania. In the middle of August M. Broliono
was in agreement with our enemies in principle and
reserved the moment of_stnking, but made it. de-
pendent on certain conditions of a military character.
Until then the King had repeatedly and most con-
vincingl assured us that he would remain neutiul
in all e rcumstances. ’I‘ho Rumnnian Minister here,
on the King's c0mmnnd,mndo me a. formal declara-
tion that the King desired to maintain the neutrality
of Rumania, and that his Government was in a posi-
tion to carry this out. (Hear, hear.) M. Brntinno
declared to Boron Busscho that. he completely on.-
dorsed the Killﬁ's view.

We dld not. a ow ourselves to be deceived by this
statement. We were continuously informed of M.
Bratinno's negotiations in August, and no con-
tinually drew the king's attention, reminding him
of his neutrality promises, to his Premier's secret
machinations, and we did the some among numerous
political Rumnruou factors who were resolved to work
against the war. The hing-repeatedly declared that
he (lid not believe tnnt M. Bruthmo had bound him-
self to tho Ententc or would bind himself. Still, six
days before the war the King declared to our Minister
that. he know the great majority of the Rumouian
people did not want war. To a conﬁdent be de«
clarcd on the some day emphatically that. he would.I
not sign an order for main motion. On August 26.
the day before the Rumanian declaration of war,
he said to tho Austro-Hungorion Minister
that he did not want war. (Hear, hear.)
I mention on a curious thing that M. Brntinno on the
some day assured the Anetta-Hungarian rcprcscntm
tire that ho was determined to maintain uculrnlitv,
and that. the result of the Council fixed for the follow-
ing day would confirm the truth of his words.

. shaman LINE unto.
(From G. Ward Price.)

osruovo, Sam. '25. '

A very violent fight took place in the early
hours of this morning upon the high ridges of
Kaymaktehalan, 8,000ft. up among the mists.

" Last week the Serbians capturedthc summit,

which dominates the other slopes, yet the ’B‘ul- D

garians held obstinatcly on to One particular

» shoulder, where the oppOSing trenches 'are close

together. The mountain-guns, trench-mortars,
and a. few field-pieces that it had been possible
to drag up there have been unccasingly‘cngagi‘d
for the last day or two, and yesterday the Bul-
garians had received “reinforcements, which on-
abled them to make another attack to try to
retake the lost positions.

At 4 o’clock this morning these were thrown
forward with the rest in a most desperate assault,
which soon became a. hand~to-lmnd struggle in
the darkncss. Thchospitals here have many
wounded, who, when brought in to-duy,' had
tips of broken-off bayoncts sticking in their
wounds, so savagely did Bulgarian and Serbian

stab and hack each other on those rocky moun- _

min-slopes. ~ -

When dawn broke the Serbian guns did terrible
execution among the Bulgarians, whose losses
are thought to exceed those of the Serbiuns,

though those are naturally heavy. Still, the Scr- P

bian lino held good through it all.

BULGARIANS DISPERSED.

The General Officer Commanding the. British
Forces at Salonika reports :-— _ ’ -

On our Doiran front our artillery was success?
ful in dispersing enemy working parties. The
enemy‘s aircraft have been very active, and it is
reported that one machine was brought down
by our fire.

On our Struma front. the Royal Navy shelled
an enemy column near Razolidos [‘2 Rcdholivos,
north of Orfano] and the French artillery a
column at chimah [at the head of Lake
Tachinos]. Both columns were dispersed. A
patrol encounter took place cast of Orljak bridge
[south-west of Sores], in which we compelled
the enemy to retire after inﬂicting some casual-
ties on them. ‘

' ‘ho railway station at Angista [on the.Drama
railway] was bombed by aeroplanes of‘ the
R.N.A.S. , > 3

The following ofﬁcial report was received yes-
terday from the Headquarters of the French
Orient Army at Salonika :-—-

On the Struma front the British artillery bom- '

barded enemy cantonments. In the direction of
chimah a Bulgarian column which came under
the ﬁre of the heavy batteries suffered losses
and dispersed. ,

From the Boles Mountains 10 the Vardar there
was patrol activity and intermittent artillery
ﬁring. ,

0n. the Serbian front the enemy did not renew
his attacks on Kaymnktchalan. The few sections
of. trenches taken by the Bulgarians at this point
cost them heavy losses, owing to the stubborn
resistance of the Serbian troclps. . ,

On our left wing two Bulgarian attacks directed
against our positions east. and west of Florina
met~with the violent ﬁre of the Franco-Russian
troops and were broken before reaching our lines.
