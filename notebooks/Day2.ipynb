    "## 1. Curation\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    "> Data curation is a term used to indicate management activities related to organization and integration of data collected from various sources, annotation of the data, and publication and presentation of the data such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Data curation includes \"all the processes needed for principled and controlled data creation, maintenance, and management, together with the capacity to add value to data\". In science, data curation may indicate the process of extraction of important information from scientific texts, such as research articles by experts, to be converted into an electronic format, such as an entry of a biological database. The term is also used in the humanities, where increasing cultural and scholarly data from digital humanities projects requires the expertise and analytical practices of data curation. In broad terms, curation means a range of activities and processes done to create, manage, maintain, and validate a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "> According to the University of Illinois' Graduate School of Library and Information Science, \"Data curation is the active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Curation being a field of its own, we will pass on the actual technics behind it. For this course, we will use a precurated dataset, the [eBooks@Adelaide dataset](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/)."
