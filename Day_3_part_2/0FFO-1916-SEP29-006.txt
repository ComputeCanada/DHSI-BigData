“War: 8rd Year: 57th Day;

Steady progress is being made on the British
Front. Yesterday the Schwabcn Redoubt was
attacked. Most of it is in British hands." It
occupies the crest of the Thicpval plateau, with
a full view over the noﬁborn valley of the

'Anorc. , \ r .

Elsewhere also our lines have been advanced;—
nortlrnnd north-east of Courcelctto and‘bc-
tween Martinpuich and Guoudecourt. TItier-o
we have established posts west and south-west
of Eauoourt l‘Abbayc, and are within 800 yards

‘ of the village.

The British dispatch last night again commended
highly the Work of the airmen, and quoted a
captured report from the commander of the
German corps who took part in the battle.
He describes the valour of the British infantry,
and complains that the Germans on the Somme
front “found actually no trenches at all ”--a
tribute‘to the work of the British guns.

The afternoon dispatch showed that the ﬁghting
of the last two days has been “singularly
economical.” 0hr losses are small absolutely,
as well as relatively to the importance of our
gains. I . '

Our Correspondent at Headquarters describes lo-

_ day the work of tho “ Tanks ”-—-vcry useful in
the taking of Thiepval and of Gucudccourtl—
and the stem, hidden figllting'tllat Went on in
the warren of German subterranean passages
with which the ground under these strong.
holds is pierced.

The Paris communiqué yesterday afternoon rc-
portcd no infantry action on the French front
in the West. It said that the French batteries
“are continuing actively their fire upon the
German organizations.” The evening coln‘
muniqzlé also mentioned heavy artillery fire.

At Verdun, the enemy has suffered what the

French describe as “ a sanguinary defeat.” I

At nightfall on Wednesday he made a strong
attack against the Tlliaumont-Flcury front,
and was drivon back by machine-gun and our-
tain firc.

West of Lutsk the Germans have been making
heavy attacks on the Russian lines. The Petro-
grud colmmmiqué yesterday referred to this
lighting by saying that the enemy was “ Shaw'-
ing a stubborn resistance, making repeated
counter-attacks and thus hindering our
advance."

The German report made much more of it. It
said that the trenches lost on September 21
had been recaptured and other advantages
gained. It declared that the Siberian 4th
Army Corps “ suffered losses which ap-
proached almost to complete annihilation.”

The German Imperial Chancellor, speaking at
the opening of tho Reicllstag, snccred in Italy
for having declared war on Germany, and
violently denounced Rumcnia for having
joined the Allies.

The Provisional Government in Crete has issued
a proclamation signed by M. Venizclos and
Admiral Condouriotis. It declares that the
only hope for Greece is to join the Allies, ap-
pools to'King Constantino to declare himself
on their side, and expresses the determination
of the signatories to load Greece on that path,
even if he still refuses.

An interview given by Mr. Lloyd George to the
president of the United Press of America is
published to-day. Mr. Lloyd George makes it
perfectly plain that this is no time for peace
talk. . , ,

The names of 171 ofﬁcers and 2,560 men are
given in tho oflicial casualty lists today. In
addition we announce unofficially the death of
18 other ofﬁcers.

Thiopval is evidently a very tender subject

OF WAR.

V {moor our: conalzsroxnnx'r.)

' ATHENS, SEPT. 27.

The adhesion of Admiral Condouriotis to the
Reform Movement has impressed King Con-
stantino more than anything else.

According to the Nea Helios, all the various
generals whom the King received in audloncc
yesterday and the day before represented to hls
Majesty the necessity of a prompt. abandonment
of neutrality. The report that the lung has
deﬁnitely decided on a change of policy favour-
able to the Entcntc continues todiud currency.

tion as Chief of the General Staff is believed to be
a manmuvro to induce him to retain his post.
It is stated that 500 olliccrs are signing a petition
to the King in favour of war against Bulgaria.

M. Rollis has had an interview with the
Premier, M. Kalogcropoulos, and has urged him
to take prompt steps, since events permit of no
further delay.

The so-called “ Nationalists ” under M.
Gounoris have addressed a proclamation to the
Cretans bogging them to hold aloof from the
National Defence. movement, and. threatening
them with a reaction. ‘

A mass meeting is being held in Mylilonc to-
day.

LATER.

General Kalluris, the former Minister of War,
like Goncrul MoscllopoulO' appcars to have
drawn up two reports urgiqg the necessity of
action. Other drst-inguishc l ofﬁcers are in
sympathy with this view.

General Dan lis, another (ix-Minister of War,
has left for Sl§lonikrn  -

The Cabinet, which is said by tho Hectic:
to be ready to acquiesce in the cooperation
of two or three Vomzclists in the Government,
will probably await the reply of tho Entouto
Powers to its recent proposals before taking
any deﬁnite steps.

Public opinion is now inclined to favour the
abandonment of neutrality, and this view is
shared even by tho unti‘Venizolist Press, with
the exception of the Nca Himcra, tho reputed
or an of the old General Staff.

AI. Vonizolos, who met with an enthusiastic
rocoptionon landing in Crete, has delivered a.
speech at Canon expressing the hopo that the
wishes ‘of the nation would be fulﬁlled.

DANGEES on PASSIVE
- OPPOSITION.

PUBLIC OPINION UNANIMOUS.
We have received the following telegram
from M6 Special Correspondent at Athens

,rcho recently rent the Message from M.

Vcnizclos to The Times :—- V

The effect of the departure of M. Vcnizolos
and Admiral Condourlotis on their patriotic
crusade, together with the declarations of the
former to the Greek people (which are on
similar lines to those contoured in his messa e
to The Times transmitted in my previous tole-
gram), have created a profound impression
throughout Grcccc.

Both by his method of action and by his
declarations M. Vcnizclos has proved his
unwillingness to attack the King, and he
has shown that the po ular movement under
his leadership is cxc usively patriotic and
for the defence of his country. It is directed
simultaneously as a ﬁnal appeal to the King
to come forward. Excepting tho pro-German
faction, all in Greece, including the vast majority
of Army and Navy ofﬁcers, are urging the King
to declare war against Bulgaria and to do his
duty by the nation. ‘

It is difﬁcult to anticipate what the King‘s

persists much

 

 

sition may become if he
anger in his precept practically isolated attitude
of pessrvo opposition to the popular will.

PRINCE ANDREW 0F GREECE.
Prince Andrew of Greece yostcrday received
a telegram from King Constantino requesting
him, according to Renter’s Agency,to leave for
Paris, where he will receive fresh instructions.
The date of departure has not yet been fixed.

 

Prince Andrew of Greece, the youngest
brother of King Constantino, came recently to
London on a special mission. It is understood
that. his instructions, which woro’of a very prc-
ciso nature, were to justify the action of .Iiing
Constantine in the eyes of the British Govern-
ment and of the British Royal Faniil n There
is no reason to'beliove that he found ‘favOur in
the eyes of responsible members of tho Govern-
ment or of its representatives ; but it is possible
that the theory and practice of government in

tatively oxplaincd to him. v

SIR D. Hero ON " OUR
LOSSES.
THE LINE ADVANCED ,AT
‘ VARIOUS POINTS.
The following telegraphic dispatches were

received yesterday from. General Head-
quarters in France 2—- _' '

2,55 RBI—During the night out ho
was advanced at various points between
Martinpuich and Guoudecourt, and posts

were established west and south-west of

Eoucourt'l’Abbayc and within 800 yards
of that village.

0n the left of our front our position
was consolidated on the ridge north-east
of Thiepval. .

A battalion of enemy infantry, with
transport, was caught on the patch by
our artillery, and successftu shelled.

The ﬁghting during the past few days
has been singularly economical. Our losses
are small, not only relatively to the im-
portance of 'our gains, but absolutely.
Our total casualties are not more than
twice the number of enemy prisoners
taken. One division, which had a. 8 col.
ally difﬁcult task allotted to it, too as
many prisoners as it suffered casualties.

 P.M.—-To-clay we attacked the
nchwabon Redoubt, most of which is in
our hands. During the past 24 hours in
this area. nearly 600 prisoners have been
taken.

The Redoubt occupies the crest 500
yards north of Thicpval, and represents

the highest ground on the Thiepval l

Spur, with a full view over the
northern valley of the Ancrc.
Elsewhere on our front we have con-
solidated our ground and advanced our
lines north and north-east of Courcelette.
British aeroplanes have, as usual, during
the past few days coo crated brilliantly
with the infantry. llbch damage has
been done to enemy batteries, and there
have been many instances of our a ro-
plancs attacking troops and transport
on the ground with machine-gun ﬁre.
- A captured report of the ﬁghting on
the Somme issued by the Commander of
the German Corps which took part in the
battle contains a tribute to the quality of
our troops. '

The British infantry are smart in attack,
largely because of their iuunonse conﬁdence
in their great artillery superiority. One
must admit the skill with which they con-
solidate themsclves in newly-gained positions.
They show great tenacity in the defence.
Small parties when once established with
machine-guns in the corner of a wood or a
group of houses arorvcry difficult to dis-
edge.

The following sentence shows the effects
of our artillery :-—

Hitherto our instructions, from cxpori~
cnco gained in defence and attack, were
based on n. carefully-constructed trench
sysmm. Tho troops on. the Somme front
found actually no trenches at all.

 

FRENCH BATTERIES ACTIVE
ON THE SOMME.
The following French cmlzmum‘gués were
issued yesterday :—
ETERNOON.

0n the Somme front our batteries
actively continued to bombard the Ger-
man organizations.

There were no infantry counter-at-
tacks during the night.

Apart from the violent bombardment
which continues on the Somme front
there is nothing of importance to report;
along the whole front. ‘ '

SPEECH IN. THE
a ,REICHSTAG.

 

THE FAVOURABLE
MOMENT. .

The following wireless message from Berlin
has been received by the Wireless Press :—

Tho Rciohstag opened this afternoon with
the usual napect of similar great days. 'The
galleries were crowded. All the foreign diplo-
matists staying in Berlin wore present, practi-
cally without exception. ‘ ‘ ,

President Kampf, in an introductory speech,
stated that the military, economic, and political
war had. reached its zenith. On all fronts there were
violent struggles for a. decision. Germany's position
was satisfactory in every respect: The President
mentioned the arrival of the merchant. submarines
Deuuchland and Bremen in the United States and
road the telegrams exchanged with the Emperor at
the beginning of the third. year of war. .

AMSTERDAM, Sept. 2S.——Aiter the Presrdcnt’s
speech the Imperial Chancellor said :—

Wlleu, alter Italy’s declaration of war on Austria-
Hungory our Ambassador left Rome, we infomlcd
the Italian Government that in a. war against Austria.~
Hungary they would also have to meet German
troops.‘ German troops. united with Austro-ilun-
garian comrades, fought on the Italian front. Thus
a dc [auto state of war was established, and a formal
declaration of war did not follow. Italy obviously
wanted to avoid the fateful consequences for her
economic relations with us after the war. In Rome,
also they would have liked to shift. the responsibility
for the initiative upon us, but we had no reason to
play Italy’s game. '

That our tactics were right was proved by the
continual ellorta of tho Entcntc to induce Italy to
declare war. For more than a year the Italian Govcm-
mcnt resisted. but ﬁnally the thumb-screws became
too painful which England was putting on with the
some rutlllcssncss on neutrals as on the Allies. Italy
in her war is depending on English coal and English
money, but certainly English coercion was docrswe,
though perhaps also Italian Balkan n iratious may
lave contributed their share. A3 is wcl known Italy
wants territorial extension-in the districts which fall
in the natural sphere of Greek interests. In order
to avoid being passed over completely, Italy con-
sidered it desirable to participate in General Sarrail's
expedition. This led to a renewed collision between
Italian and German troops in Macedonia. Thus the
declaration of war on us developed, and at the some
timo Romania joined our enemies.

fl‘nu Tamra wrm Aus‘ran.

Our relations with Ruluam'a before the war rested
on the Treaty of Alliance, which was ﬁrst concluded
only between Austria-Hungary and Rumania, and
was extended by the entry of Germany and Italy.
The signatories bound themselves to reciprocal armed
assistance in case of unprovoked _uttack from a
third side. When war broke out hing Carol ener-
gctically upheld the conception that. Rumonia,.xvllich
owed to the Central Powers 30 years of secure
political existence and immense progress, should not
only according to the words of the Treaty, but also on
account of the country's honour, join the Central
Powers. To the late King it. appeared to be a re-
pudintion of the Alliance Treaty to raise the objec-
tion that. Romania had not been informed of the
Austro-Hungnricn dénmrchc against Serbia, and had
not been consulted about it, but in the decisive
Crown Council the aged hing did not. press his
opinion against. the Government, the head of which,
ignoring all existing treaties, sympathizcd with tho
Eutcntc. Shortly afterwards the King died as the
result of mental excitement caused by the conscious-
ness that Rumania lmd betrayed Ilcr Allies. ’

The Ilumanian policy under M. Brutiano's leader-
ship armed. at cnrlchmg itself without having to
make goat‘sacriflccs. It was, a question only of
recognizing in time to which side victory ﬁnally
inclined, and than not. to miss the favourable oppor-
tunlty for coming in. In the first year of the war,

.,. .

cludcd a. neutrality treaty with Russia behind his
Sovereign's back. After the fall of Przcmysl ho con~
sidorod the time had come to arrive at. an agreement
with our. cnolnlcs about the reward of Judas. Tho
negotiations failed. Russia desired to browse her
own immense territorial possessions by adding Buko-
vino. to them. Serbia had thrown e as on the Ballot,
while Bumania wanted for horse

ggkovinu but all Hungarian territory as for as tho

‘ clss.

Thus no agreement was reached, but Romania’s
neutrality took more and more the form of one-
sided favouring of the Eutcnto Powers. In order to
support England's starvation blockade they tried
to old back corn bought by us. It required our very
energetic pressure to' compel its release. After the

ush'ut Gorlicc M. Braticno had doubts as to whether

c was on the right horse. Negotiations with the
Entcntc, which had been suspended, come visibly to
a. deadlock, because it was always the military situa-
tion which influenced Rumonian policy. When the
Russians opened their spring offensive, and at the
some time the Somme offensive began M. Broth-mo
thought he saw before his eyes the collapse of the
Central Powers. 'ow he was resolved. to partici-
pate in the anticipated funeral feast.

Fixan NmleATloxs 1x Bonanza.

The Enteuto Powers also in their negotiations
with .\l. Braliano lmd u frocr hand than heretofore.
Serbia. having been conquered. the protectors
of small and weak nations had no need fur-
ther to consider her former annexation de-
sires. They could be more generous towards
Romania. In the middle of August M. Braliano
was in agreement with our enemies in principle and
reserved the moment ol_strlkiug, but made it de-
pendent on certain conditions of a military character.
Until then the King had repeatedly and must con-
vincingl assured us that he would remain ueutiul
in all e rcumstauocs. Tho Rumnnian Minister here,
on tho King's command,mndo me a. formal declara-
tion that the King desired to maintain the neutrality
of Rumania, and that his Gowrnment was in a posi-
tion to carry this out. (Hear, hear.) M. Bratinno
declared to Baron Busscho that he completely on-
domcd tllc Kinﬁ's View.

We dld not a ow ourselves to be deceived by this
statement. We were continuously informed of M.
Bratinno's negotiations in August, and we con-
tinually drew the king's attention, reminding him
of his neutrality promises, to his Premier's secret
machinations, and we did the same among numerous
political Rumnruou factors who were resolved to work
against the war. The hing-repeatedly declared that
he rlid not believe tnat M. Brutllmo had bound him-
self to the Entonte or would bind himself. Still, six
days before the war the King declared to our Minister-
tllot he know the great majority of the Rulnanian
people did not want war. To a conﬁdant be de«
clarcd on the sumo day emphatically that he would.I
not sign an order for main motion. On August 26.
the day before the Rlu‘uanian declaration of war,
he said to tho Austro-Hungarion Minister
that he did not want war. (Hear, hear.)
I mention as a curious thing that M. Bratiano on the
some day assured the Allure-Hungarian rcprcsontm
live that ho was determined to maintain ueulrnlitv,
and that the result of the Council fixed for the follow-
ing day would conllrm the truth of his words.

. 'SBRBIAN LINE nan.
(From G. Ward Price.)

osr'uovo, Sm. '25.  '

A very violent fight took place in the early
hours of this morning upon the high ridges of
Kayrnaktchalan, 8,000ft. up among the mists.

" Last week the Serbians oapturccitho summit,

which dominates the other slopes, yet the ’B‘ul- D ‘

garians held obstinately on to One particular

» shoulder, where the oppOSing trenches are close

together. The mountain-guns, trench-mortars,
and a. few field-pieces that it had been possible
to drag up there have been unceasioglycngagi‘d
for the last day or two, and yesterday the Bul-
garians had received “reinforcements, which on-
ablod them to make another attack to try to
retake the lost positions.

At 4 o’clock this morning these were thrown
forward with the rest in a most desperate assault,
which soon became a. hand~to-lland struggle in
the darkncss. Tbehospitals here have many
wounded, who, when brought in to-day,' had
tips of broken-off bayoncts sticking in their
wounds, so savagely did Bulgarian and Serbian

stab and back each other on those rocky moun- _

min-slopes. ~ -

When dawn broke the Serbian guns did terrible
execution among the Bulgarians, whose losses
are thought to exceed those of the Serbians,

though those are naturally heavy. Still, the Sor- 

bian lino held good through it all.

BULGARIANS DISPERSED.

The General Ofﬁcer Commanding the. British
Forces at Salonika reports :-— _ ’ -

On our Doiran front our artillery was success?
ful in dispersing enemy working parties. The
enemy‘s aircraft have been very active, and it is
reported that one machine was brought down
by our fire.

On our Strnmn front the Royal Navy shelled
an enemy column near Razolidos [‘2 Radholivos,
north of Oriana] and the French artillery a
colunm at Yenimah [at the head of Lake
Tachinos]. Both columns were dispersed. A
patrol encounter took place cast of Orljak bridge
[south-west of Sores], in which we compelled
the enemy to retire after inﬂicting some casual-
ties on them. ‘

' ‘ho railway station at Angista. [on theDrama
railway] was bombed by aeroplanes of‘ the
R.N.A.S. , >

The following ofﬁcial report was received yes-
terday from the Headquarters of the French
Orient Army at Salonika :-—-

On the Struma front the British artillery bom- '

bardod enemy cantonments. In the direction of
Yenimah a Bulgarian column which came under
the ﬁre of the heavy batteries suffered losses
and dispersed. .

From the Boles Mountains 10 the Vardar there
was patrol activity and intermittent artillery
ﬁling. r

0n. the Serbian front the enemy did not renew
his attacks on Kaymaktchalan. The few sections
of. trenches taken by the Bulgarians at this point
cost them heavy losses, owing to the stubborn
resistance of the Serbian troOps. . ,

On our left wing two Bulgarian attacks directed
against our positions cast. and west of Florina
mot~with the violent ﬁre of the Franco-Russian
troops and were broken before reaching our lines.
